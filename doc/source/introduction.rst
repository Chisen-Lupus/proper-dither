Introduction
============

`proper-dither` is a Python package designed for executing a proper coaddition method of undersampled dithered images, as described by Lauer et al. It provides tools to process astronomical images, enabling high-quality image coaddition for datasets obtained with undersampled cameras.

Features:
---------

- Legacy and updated coaddition methods.
- Utility functions for image processing.
- A wrapper for streamlined workflows.
- Tutorials for hands-on learning.
